# Getting And Cleaning Data Project

Repository for the submission of the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera Project.

### Overview
This project is my submission on collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent
analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### Making Modifications to This Script
Please change the working directory on line 5 of run_analysis.R before you try running the script.

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions from the assignment of the Coursera Class.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
